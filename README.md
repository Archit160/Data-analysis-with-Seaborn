### Visualizations and Key Insights

#### 1. More Movies than TV Shows
Netflix's library is heavily skewed towards movies, which constitute over two-thirds of the content.

#### 2. Top Content Producing Countries
The United States is the dominant content producer, with India a distant but clear second. This highlights Netflix's focus on these two major markets.

#### 3. Most TV Shows Have Only One Season
A significant majority of TV series on the platform are single-season shows. This could point to a strategy of releasing limited series or a high rate of shows not being renewed.
